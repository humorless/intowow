CF(Collaborative Filtering)-based Movie Recommendation Service

The website should provide the following features:
1. For guest users (user not logged in), the website recommend movies with highest average ratings

2. Users can sign-up for a new account, providing his/her
   * email
   * password
   a) If the email has been registered before, the website will reject the sign-up

3. Users can sign-in with his/her (email, password) pair

4. After signing-in, the website will 
   a) Show movies which have been rated by the user.
   b) Recommend a list of movies, which have not been rated by the user.
   c) The recommendation should based on CF and MovieLens dataset
      Please refer:
        MovieLens dataset :  http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
        CF : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering
      Using 100K MovieLens dataset is acceptable. However, using larger ones is encouraged.
      You can use any CF algorithms or libraries. However, the hand-in should explain
      why you chose them and how you used them in the project.

5. For each recommended movie, user can rate it on a 1 star-5 stars scale.

6. After the movie is rated, it is removed from the recommendation list.

7. The website will remember these ratings, combine them with existing movie rating data,
   and recompute the recommendation model on a periodical basis. For demostration, this
   period should be as short as possible (< 10sec).

8. The recommendation list will dynamically reloads itself based on the up-to-date model.
   (So rated movies will never appear in recommendation list)
   Note that reloading the whole webpage is unacceptable. The page should only update the
   recommendation list part.
